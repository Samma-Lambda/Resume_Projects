Notice how if we rearrange our recursive relation we can see the identity that $a_n-k_1a_{n-1}-k_2a_{n-2}-...-k_qa_{n-q}=0$, lets define a polynomial $P(x)=a_nx^0-k_1a_{n-1}x^1-k_2a_{n-2}x^2-...-k_qa_{n-q}x^q$. Now if we multiply $P(x)$ and $G(x)$ we find that the result is finite, because the way that polynomial multiplication works results in all $x^n$ where $n>q$ to have a coefficent of $0$, and we can calculate the non-zero part of the this resulting polynomial which we can call $Q(x)$\n",

    "# 2.1 Finding roots of high degree polynomials\n",
    "It is a pretty well known fact within the mathematical community that there is no quintic equation using only addition, multiplication and exponentionals. But there are computation ways that approximate the roots of a degree five or higher polynomial. One such example is using QR decomposition to solve something known as the companion matrix which is defined to be $$C = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\ c_0 & c_1 & c_2 & \\cdots & c_{n-1}\\end{bmatrix}$$ where our polynomial that we walk to solve the roots of is $c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^1+...+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}$. The eigenvalues of this matrix are actually the roots of these polynomials. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering now, why does this help since usally to find an eigenvalue you need to solve the charecteristic polynomial, but we can actually find eigenvalues a different way. By QR decomposition we can write an invertible matrix $A$ as $QR$ where $Q$ is orthogonal and $R$ is triangular, additionally we can see that $Q^{-1}AQ=Q^{-1}QRQ=RQ$. This proves that $Q^{-1}AQ$ and $RQ$ have the same eigenvalues, and by well known properties of determinates it also means that $A$ and $RQ$ have the same eigenvalues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then by repeatedly doing this, taking our matrix $A_{n}$ and then placing it into the form of $A_{n}=QR$ and then defining $A_{n+1}=RQ$, after enough iterations we will eventually have a triangular matrix, or at least close enough for our liking. Additionally it is a well known fact that the diagonal entires of a triangular matrix are the eigenvalues(and thus roots of our polynomial) so we have sucessfully found roots to our polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "Beneath I have writen code to do this process, I chose not to use the numpy package because it has a build in function that does QR decomposition and I didn't think that it would be very conducive to my learning experience doing that. "
