    "## Creating a class for representing multiple qubits and their operations \n",
    "Each individual qubit can be represented as a two dimensional vector with scalars from the feild of complex numbers. Formally this means that each qubit can be represented in the form $\\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle$ where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers such that $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$. Note that $|0\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "<br><br><br><br><br>\n",
    "But representing qubits alone is not very useful we need to be able to represent multiple qubits and their interactions. We can take the vector representation of two qubits and represent both of them using a single vector with the kronecker product. The kronecker product between two vectors is defined as follows:\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "a_1 \\\\\n",
    "a_2\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \\otimes \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "b_1 \\\\\n",
    "b_2 \n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "a_1 b_1 \\\\\n",
    "a_1 b_2 \\\\\n",
    "a_2 b_1 \\\\\n",
    "a_2 b_2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$. Note that when we take the kronecker product of two vectors with the basis vectors $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ we get a vector with the basis vectors $|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$ and $|11\\rangle$(This is amazing because it allows us to represent every possible state of $n$ qubits with one vector). We can do this with any number of qubits and can represent the state of $n$ qubits using a $2^n$ dimensional vector.\n",
    "<br><br><br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally we can represent the operations on indivigual qubits using matrix multiplication. For example the bitflip operation can be represented as the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. Notice how this maps $|0\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ to $|0\\rangle$, like how classical bits are flipped. We can operate on the state of two qubits using the kronecker product of two matrices because the kronker product has the nice property of $(A\\otimes B) (x \\otimes y)=(Ax) \\otimes (By)$. This is how we can represent operations on multiple qubits using a single matrix.\n",
    "<br><br><br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to work with qubits in this way we will create a class. I made it easier to take the kroncker product of two qubits by defining the \\_\\_add\\_\\_ method to take the kroncker product of two qubits and return a new qubit string representing both of them. I also wrote methods that allow us to apply operations to single qubits within the state using kronecker products of matrices. I called this class qubitstring. "

Classically to solve this you would see if $f(0)\\oplus f(1)=0$($\\otimes$ denoting the xor operation) and if this statement is true than the function is constant otherwise it is balanced. \n",

    "2. Pass then into the function $f(|x\\rangle \\otimes |y\\rangle)=|x\\rangle \\otimes |y\\oplus f(x)\\rangle$\n",

    "This algorithm blew my mind when I first learned about it because it looks like we are only changing the second qubit, but somehow the first qubit is affected by the function. This is because of someything called phase kickback. I don't understand why from a physics reason phase kickback happens, but I can show you how it works mathematically. The kronecker product has the property that $a \\otimes \\lambda b = \\lambda a \\otimes b = \\lambda(a \\otimes b)$. So if you scale the second qubit, it is the same as scaling the first qubit, or the representation of both qubits. Thus by applying a scalar to the second qubit, we can change the state of the first qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $f(|+\\rang \\otimes |-\\rang)=|+\\rang \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\oplus f(x)\\rang - |1 \\oplus f(x)\\rang)$. Because $0$ is the identity of XOR $0 \\oplus f(x)=f(x)$, and because XOR $1$ is the equivalent of a bitflip $1 \\oplus f(x) = \\overline{f(x)}$ with $\\overline{f(x)}$ being the negation of $f(x)$. Thus $|+\\rang \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\oplus f(x)\\rang - |1 \\oplus f(x)\\rang)=|+\\rang \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|f(x)\\rang - |\\overline{ f(x)}\\rang)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the way the value of $f(x)$ rearranges the state, we can see $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|f(x)\\rang - |\\overline{ f(x)}\\rang)=(-1)^{f(x)}|-\\rang$. Thus our state is $|+\\rang \\otimes (-1)^{f(x)}|-\\rang$. This allows us to use the amazing properties of the kronecker product that $a \\otimes\\lambda b = \\lambda a \\otimes b$, meaning we can further rewrite our state as $(-1)^{f(x)}|+\\rang \\otimes |-\\rang$. Scaling $|+\\rang$ by $(-1)^{f(x)}$ we can see that the state of the two qubits is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}((-1)^{f(0)}|0\\rang +(-1)^{f(1)}|1\\rang)\\otimes |-\\rang$. Notice that in this state the first qubit will be in the state $|+\\rang$ if $f(0)=f(1)$ and $|-\\rang$ if $f(0)\\neq f(1)$. Thus by applying the hammard gate to the first qubit and measuring it we can determine wether the function is balanced or constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the speedup of this algorithm is not very significant, as instead of querying the function twice we only query it once. But later using the duetsch jorza algorithm we can see that we can get a significant speedup by using quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The brief explaination of this code is that if its an injective function it only kicks back once by $\\pi$ and if it is a constant function it kicks back by $2\\pi$(when both map to $1$) or kicks back by $0$(when everything maps to $0$). Thus because a kickback of $2\\pi$ is equivalent to no kickback, we can determine wether the function is constant or injective by checking if the first qubit is unchanged or not."

    "## Quantum Phase Estimation\n",
    "This is an algorithm that given an eigenvector $v$ and a unitary matrix $U$ this algorithm finds the eigenvalue of $v$. Note that since $U$ is unitary the eigenvalues of $U$ are of the form $e^{2i\\pi\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is a real number. So to simplify this problem rather than finding the eigenvalue we will find $\\theta \\in [0,1]$, note that there are other possible values of $\\theta$ but by narrowing our range there will be a unique value of $\\theta$. The algorithm specifically for the 2x2 matrix case is as follows:\n",
    "1. Prepare $n$ precision qubits in the state $|0\\rang^{\\otimes n}$ where $n$ is the bits of precision you want\n",
    "2. Prepare a qubit in the state $|v\\rang$\n",
    "3. Apply the Hadamard gate to the first $n$ qubits\n",
    "4. Set up a control gate for each precision qubit $i$ that applies $U^{2^i}$ to the qubit |v\\rang\n",
    "5. Apply the inverse fourier transform to the first $n$ qubits\n",
    "6. Measure the first $n$ qubits\n",
    "7. The result is the binary representation of $\\theta$ with $n$ bits of precision\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is another case where phase kick explains it all. Whenever we apply the unitary matrix $U^n$ to the qubit $|v\\rang$ we it becomes $e^{2i\\pi\\theta n}|v\\rang$. By applying $U^1$ whenever the first control bit is $1$, $U^2$ whenever the second control bit is $1$, $U^4$ when the third control bit is $1$ and so on we can see that the state of $|x_n...x_1\\rang$ after applying all of these controled gates is $e^{2 i\\pi \\theta x_n...x_1}|x_n...x_1\\rang$ where $x_n...x_1$ is a number represented in binary. Thus if we have $n$ precision bits our final state is $|0...0\\rang +E^{2 i \\pi \\theta n}|0...1\\rang+...+E^{2 i \\pi \\theta n}|1...1\\rang$ which when we apply a inverse fourier transformation, which then places our state into the form $|\\theta\\rang$ which then we measure as $\\theta$.
